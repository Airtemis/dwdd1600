                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Greek gods have long outlived the mortals they reside over. Earthquakes, tsunamis, sicknesses, and turmoil have taken the lives of mankind since time began. So why are the mortals outliving the gods in this day and age? Metaphorically speaking, of course.</p>
                    <p>Mankind has evolved beyond what we thought them capable of. They have invented lights that burn without fire, they keep warm in the harshest of winters, and see harvest throughout the entire year— something Demeter would balk at,  no doubt. It is because they are changing and adapting. They are overcoming the earthquakes, the plagues, the floods and the fires. We, as Greek gods, have become too complacent in our surroundings and have forgotten how to change as our charges have. So I hope you find my site helpful as you relearn how to navigate this ever-changing mortal realm.</p>
                <h2>The Basics of Modern Nutrition</h2>
                    <p>Many things have changed in the past several hundred years. The world of man has broken through what we knew to be the rigid class system and into what they call here in America “Capitalism”. Anyone anywhere can be anything they wish to be, as long as they have the drive to do it. Because of this, many different foods have sprung out of nowhere and changed cuisine as we know it. In these days, it is common to go to a coffee shop in the morning to get your daily caffeine allotment. Drinking anything else, especially wine (looking at you, Dionysus), seems to be frowned upon until at least the afternoon. Investigate local restaurants and try different dishes to explore what new tastes you may enjoy. Personally, as Goddess of the Hunt, I thoroughly enjoy my meat platters at <a href="tools.html#bbq">any given BBQ restaurant.</a></p>
                <h2> The Basics of Modern Transportation</h2>
                    <p>Mankind has been granted permission, to some extent, by Zeus and Poseidon to travel through their domains. Fortunately, however, it is not often that common men need to use these methods for daily commute to their worksites. Horseless carriages, known simply as “cars”, is the most common method of transportation… though it requires a mortal test of knowledge to acquire permission of operation, and I have <em> very little hope</em> for most of you to achieve such a feat. I instead recommend a service called “ride sharing”, where a mortal will drive you to your destination for you in exchange for a monetary payment. <strong>Please do not bewitch or charm your driver into doing this for free, or you may be banned from future services.</strong></p> Consider the following rideshare platforms:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uber</li>
                            <li>Lyft</li>
                            <li>A bus</li>
                            <li>Trains</li>
                        </ul>
